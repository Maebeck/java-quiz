# java-quiz (UNF)

#I ran out of time to work on the project, I will be resubmitting at a later time. 

# On this page, there are four questions being asked to the user with four possible answers.

# With the selection of an answer, a "submit" button will appear which allows the user to continue onto the next question. It also refreshes the the box and all the
buttons with new content
